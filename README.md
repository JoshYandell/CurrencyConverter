# CurrencyConverter
Currency Converter group project for FDM training.

The goal of the project was to create a console application that would take inputs from a user including a currency code to convert to,
currency code to convert from, and an amount to convert. One of the currencies must be Euros. 
Conversion rates are accessed live from the European Central Bank.
